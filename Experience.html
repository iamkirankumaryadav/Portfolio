In short, the sustenance team should be able to answer everything related to the pipelines or else should help to connect with the exact team who is responsible for solving the existing issue.

QA testers play a crucial role in the entire workflow:
1. Test Planning: They collaborate with the ML Tech Dev Team to understand the requirements and create test plans and strategies.
2. Test Case Creation: QA testers design test cases based on functional requirements to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
3. Test Execution: They execute test cases and perform various types of testing, such as functional, regression, performance, and usability testing.
4. Bug Reporting: If issues are found during testing, QA team document and report them to the ML Tech Dev Team.
5. RT (Regression Testing): After bug fixes or updates, QA team conduct RT to ensure that existing features are still functioning correctly.
6. UT (Usability Testing): They assess the user-friendliness and overall user experience of the pipeline.
8. PT (Performance Testing): QA team check the tool's performance under various load conditions to ensure it can handle the expected usage.
9. CT (Compatibility Testing): They verify that the pipeline works correctly across different platforms, browsers, and devices. (Not required)
10. Continuous Improvement: QA testers provide feedback to the development team to enhance the quality of the pipelines and its features.
 Documentation: Creating and maintaining test documentation, including test cases, test plans, and test reports.

Overall, the primary goal of QA team is to identify, address any issues and ensure a high-quality and reliable pipeline before its released to PROD.

Prod Training Environment: It's a separate environment that mimics the production environment where users can be trained on the system without affecting the live production data.
Prod (Production) Environment: This is the live and operational environment where the final version of the software or application or pipeline runs and is accessed by end-users or customers. It's the environment where real business transactions occur, so it must be stable, secure, and well-maintained. Changes should be thoroughly tested before deployment to avoid disruptions to the live system.
